# Using spark

`spark` is a CLI for the Spark email client. Use it to query the user's mailbox, calendar, contacts, meetings, and team data.

## Running spark

```bash
spark <command> [options]
```

**Environment:** `spark` is a thin client that talks over IPC to the user's running Spark macOS Desktop app - it does not ship its own mailbox, network stack, or credentials. Run it directly on the user's Mac against the live Spark Desktop process. Do not try to execute it inside a sandbox, container, CI runner, or any environment isolated from the user's desktop session - it will fail to connect. If Spark Desktop is not running, ask the user to launch it instead of retrying.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `accounts` | List accounts, calendars, teams, shared inboxes, and access levels |
| `folders` | List folders/labels with message counts |
| `emails` | List emails with filters and pagination |
| `search` | Hybrid keyword + semantic search with full bodies |
| `thread` | Read full thread - headers, bodies, attachments |
| `draft` | Create or edit an email draft (new, reply, forward) |
| `comment` | Post a team comment on a thread |
| `events` | List calendar events for a time range |
| `availability` | Find free time slots, optionally with attendees |
| `contacts` | Search contacts by name or email |
| `team` | Show team info, members, shared inboxes, assignments |
| `meetings` | List meeting transcripts |
| `meeting` | Read a single meeting transcript |
| `action` | Perform actions on emails (archive, pin, snooze, assign, etc.) |
| `contact-action` | Perform actions on contacts (block, accept, categorize, etc.) |

### accounts

List all configured accounts with their calendars, teams, and shared inboxes. Each account and shared inbox shows its **access level** in parentheses, which controls what operations Spark can perform.

```bash
spark accounts
```

Run this first to discover what accounts, calendars, and teams are available, and to check their access levels.

**Access levels:**

| Level | Allowed operations |
|-------|-------------------|
| **read-only** | List, search, and read emails, threads, folders, events, contacts, meetings, teams |
| **triage** | Everything in read-only plus all write operations: drafts, team comments, email actions (archive, move, pin, snooze, assign, etc.) and contact actions (block, accept, categorize, etc.) |

Access levels are configured separately for each account and each shared inbox in Spark Desktop under Settings -> AI Agents. Shared inboxes can have a different access level than the parent account - for example, a personal account may have triage access while a shared inbox under the same team is read-only or disabled.

If a command requires a higher access level than the account or shared inbox has, it returns an error with instructions on how to change the level.

### folders

List folders with message counts. Output includes folder identifiers in parentheses - use these as arguments to `emails` and `search`. Mailboxes backed by a Google account show `(Gmail labels)` on the **Email Account** or **Shared Inbox** header. Teams show the team name as a usable identifier for `emails`.

```bash
spark folders                        # all accounts
spark folders user@example.com       # single account
```

### emails

List emails with metadata (ID, From, Date, Subject, Flags). Supports pagination and Gmail-style filters.

```bash
spark emails                                                   # Unified Inbox
spark emails user@example.com:Archive                          # specific folder
spark emails "My Team"                                         # all shared threads in a team
spark emails --filter "from:alice@co.com is:unread"             # filtered
spark emails --filter "newer_than:7d has:attachment"            # recent with attachments
spark emails --page 2 --page-size 20                           # pagination
spark emails --order ascending                                 # oldest first
spark emails --new-senders                                     # show only new sender emails
```

**GateKeeper filtering:** When viewing the Inbox with GateKeeper in explicit mode, new sender emails are automatically filtered out and a "New Senders" count is shown at the top. Use `--new-senders` to view those emails. Use `contact-action acceptContact <email>` or `contact-action blockContact <email>` to accept or block a sender.

**Folder identifier formats** (run `folders` to see available ones):

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Bare name | `Inbox`, `Archive` | Unified folder (cross-account) |
| `email` | `user@example.com` | Account inbox shorthand |
| `email:Folder` | `user@example.com:Archive` | Specific account folder |
| `"Team Name"` | `"My Team"` | All shared threads in a team (quote if spaces) |
| `shared@email:Folder` | `shared@co.com:Inbox` | Shared inbox folder |

**Filter operators** (combinable, Gmail-style):

| Operator | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `from:<addr>` | `from:alice@co.com` |
| `to:<addr>` | `to:bob@co.com` |
| `cc:<addr>` | `cc:team@co.com` |
| `subject:<text>` | `subject:"quarterly report"` |
| `before:yyyy/MM/dd` | `before:2026/03/01` |
| `after:yyyy/MM/dd` | `after:2026/01/01` |
| `newer_than:Xd` | `newer_than:7d` (also `w`, `m`, `y`) |
| `older_than:Xd` | `older_than:30d` |
| `has:attachment` | also `document`, `spreadsheet`, `presentation`, `reminder` |
| `is:unread` | also `read`, `starred`, `pinned`, `unreplied` |
| `is:shared` | emails shared to any team (alias for `is:shared_email`) |
| `is:shared_inbox_open` | open items in shared inbox |
| `is:shared_inbox_done` | completed/closed items in shared inbox |
| `category:personal` | also `priority`, `notification`, `newsletter`, `invitation`, `invitation_response` |
| `assigned_to:me` | emails assigned to current user |
| `assigned_to:<email>` | emails assigned to specific teammate |
| `assigned_to:unassigned` | shared inbox items with no assignee |
| `assigned_to:other` | emails assigned to someone else (not me) |
| `assigned_by:me` | emails delegated by current user |
| `filename:<name>` | `filename:report.pdf` |

### search

Hybrid keyword + semantic search returning up to 20 emails with full bodies, sorted by relevance.

```bash
spark search "quarterly report"
spark search "API integration" --filter "from:alice@co.com"
spark search "budget" --in user@example.com:Archive
spark search "vacation" --in user@example.com              # all folders in account
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<about>` | Yes | Search topic (positional) |
| `--filter` | No | Gmail-style filter (same operators as `emails`) |
| `--in` | No | Scope: account, team, folder, or shared inbox. All folders if omitted. |

**Use `search` when the user asks about a topic.** It returns email bodies so you can answer questions about content. Use `emails` when listing/browsing by folder or filters without needing bodies.

### thread

Print every message in a thread - headers, full plain-text bodies, and attachment info. After the thread summary line, lists **custom (non-system) folder labels** once for the whole thread, using qualified names like `account@domain.com:MyLabel` (same style as `folders`).

```bash
spark thread 1114                          # by message ID from emails/search output
spark thread --download-attachments 1114   # also fetch attachments via IMAP
```

Use `emails` or `search` to find message IDs (the ID column), then `thread` to read the full conversation. Use `folders` to list valid label identifiers for `action attachLabel` / `detachLabel`.

### draft

**Requires: triage** access level.

Create a new email draft or edit an existing one. The body is written in markdown and converted to HTML.

```bash
spark draft --to "alice@example.com" --subject "Hello" --body "Hi Alice, ..."
spark draft --to "alice@co.com" --to "bob@co.com" --cc "carol@co.com" --subject "Meeting" --body "..."
spark draft --edit 1234 --subject "Updated subject" --body "Updated body"
spark draft --reply-to 5678 --body "Thanks for the update!"
spark draft --forward 5678 --to "manager@co.com" --body "FYI"
spark draft --account "john@gmail.com" --to "alice@co.com" --subject "Hi" --body "..."
spark draft --to "alice@co.com" --subject "Report" --body "See attached" --attach /path/to/report.pdf
spark draft --to "alice@co.com" --subject "Files" --body "Two files" --attach /path/to/a.pdf --attach /path/to/b.xlsx
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--to` | No | Recipient address (RFC822). Repeat for multiple. |
| `--cc` | No | CC address. Repeat for multiple. |
| `--bcc` | No | BCC address. Repeat for multiple. |
| `--subject` | No | Subject line. |
| `--body` | Yes (new) | Body content in markdown. Required for new drafts. |
| `--edit` | No | Message ID of an existing draft to update. |
| `--reply-to` | No | Message ID to reply to. |
| `--forward` | No | Message ID to forward. |
| `--account` | No | Account email to send from. Accepts a regular mail account, an alias, or a shared inbox email. |
| `--attach` | No | Absolute path to a file to attach. Repeat for multiple. |

Use `emails` to find message IDs for `--edit`, `--reply-to`, and `--forward`. Use `accounts` to find account emails for `--account` - both personal accounts and shared inboxes are listed there, and either can be used as the from address when the account has draft & comment access.

### comment

**Requires: triage** access level.

Post a team comment (chat message) on a thread. If the thread is not yet shared, it will be shared automatically. Supports text comments, file attachments, or both. Use `--edit` to update an existing comment.

```bash
spark comment 1234 --body "Looks good, let's proceed."
spark comment 1234 --body "Please review this" --team "Engineering"
spark comment 1234 --body "FYI" --team "Engineering" --user alice@co.com --user bob@co.com
spark comment 1234 --attach /path/to/screenshot.png
spark comment 1234 --body "See attached" --attach /path/to/report.pdf --attach /path/to/data.csv
spark comment --edit 5678 --body "Updated comment text"
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<message-id>` | Yes (post) | Message ID of a message in the thread to comment on. |
| `--body` | When no `--attach` | Comment text to post. Required when using `--edit`. |
| `--attach` | When no `--body` | Absolute path to a file to attach. Repeat for multiple files. Each file is sent as a separate message. Cannot be used with `--edit`. |
| `--edit` | No | Message ID of an existing comment to edit. Requires `--body`. |
| `--team` | When >1 team | Team name. Required when you belong to multiple teams. |
| `--user` | When team >2 members | Teammate email to share with. Repeat for multiple. Only used when auto-sharing an unshared thread. For teams with 2 or fewer members, the whole team is shared with automatically. |

Use `emails` to find message IDs. Use `thread` to see comment IDs in a conversation. Use `team` to list teams and their members.

### events

List calendar events for a time range.

```bash
spark events                                          # today's remaining events
spark events --tomorrow
spark events --week
spark events --week --in user@example.com             # specific account
spark events --week --in user@example.com:Work        # specific calendar
spark events --start 2026-03-16 --end 2026-03-20      # custom range
```

Date formats: `yyyy-MM-dd`, `dd/MM/yyyy`, or `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`.

Run `accounts` to see available calendar accounts and calendar names.

### availability

Find free time slots. Without `--attendees`, shows the user's own availability. With `--attendees`, computes mutual free windows.

```bash
spark availability                                                        # today
spark availability --tomorrow
spark availability --week --attendees alice@co.com
spark availability --start 2026-03-16 --end 2026-03-20 --attendees a@co.com,b@co.com
```

Free slots are within working hours (08:00-20:00), skip weekends, and ignore events marked "free".

### contacts

Search contacts by name or email. Strict match first, then fuzzy fallback.

```bash
spark contacts "john"
spark contacts "example.com"
```

### team

Show team info - metadata, shared inboxes with members, full member list, assigned emails, assignment summary.

```bash
spark team                     # list available teams
spark team "Readdle"           # specific team
```

### meetings

List meeting transcripts with optional filters and pagination.

```bash
spark meetings
spark meetings --filter "newer_than:30d"
spark meetings --filter "subject:standup" --page-size 10
```

Filter operators: `subject:<text>`, `before:yyyy/MM/dd`, `after:yyyy/MM/dd`, `newer_than:Xd`, `older_than:Xd`.

### meeting

Read a single meeting transcript's summary. Optionally include the full transcript and/or notes.

```bash
spark meeting 42                            # summary only
spark meeting --transcript 42               # include transcript
spark meeting --notes 42                    # include notes
spark meeting --transcript --notes 42       # everything
```

Use `meetings` to find meeting IDs.

spark contact-action enableAutosummaryForContact newsletter@example.com
```

Use the `contacts` command to look up email addresses.

## Smart Categories

Spark automatically classifies incoming email into six categories. Use the `category:` filter operator with `emails` and `search` to view mail by category, and use `action` / `contact-action` to reclassify and tune.

| Category | Filter | Typical Content |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Priority | `category:priority` | Auto-prioritized or manually marked as priority |
| People | `category:personal` | Direct person-to-person email |
| Notifications | `category:notification` | Service notifications, alerts, receipts |
| Newsletters | `category:newsletter` | Subscriptions, digests, marketing |
| Invites | `category:invitation` | Calendar invitations |
| Invite Responses | `category:invitation_response` | RSVPs, accepts, declines |

**Browse by category** (read-only):

```bash
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:priority is:unread"       # unread priority mail
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:personal is:unread"       # unread people mail
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:invitation"               # pending invites
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:notification is:unread"   # unread notifications
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:newsletter newer_than:7d" # recent newsletters
```

**Reclassify a message** (triage):

```bash
spark action changeCategoryPersonal <id>       # move to People
spark action changeCategoryNotification <id>   # move to Notifications
spark action changeCategoryNewsletters <id>    # move to Newsletters
```

**Tune per-contact category rules** (triage) - changes apply to all future mail from the sender:

```bash
spark contact-action changeCategoryPersonal sender@example.com         # reclassify as People
spark contact-action changeCategoryNewsletters sender@example.com      # reclassify as Newsletters
spark contact-action groupEmailsFromContact sender@example.com         # group by category
spark contact-action markContactAsImportant vip@example.com            # enable notifications
spark contact-action markContactAsPrimary ceo@example.com              # auto-prioritize
spark contact-action enableAutosummaryForContact newsletter@example.com # AI summaries
```

**Category-first triage pattern:** Process inbox in priority order - priority first, then people, then invites, then notifications, then newsletters. This ensures the most important messages get attention first.

## Typical Workflows

**Answer a question about emails:**
1. `spark search "topic"` - find relevant emails with bodies
2. Read the output and answer the user's question

**Find and read a specific email:**
1. `spark emails --filter "from:sender subject:keyword"` - locate the email
2. `spark thread <ID>` - read the full conversation

**Draft a reply:**
1. `spark emails --filter "from:sender"` - find the email
2. `spark draft --reply-to <ID> --body "Thanks for the update!"`

**Check someone's schedule for a meeting:**
1. `spark availability --tomorrow --attendees alice@co.com,bob@co.com`
2. Suggest a time from the free slots

**Comment on a shared thread:**
1. `spark emails --filter "from:sender"` - find the email
2. `spark comment <ID> --body "Looks good, approved!"`

**Get team workload overview:**
1. `spark team "Team Name"` - see members and assigned emails

**Look up a contact:**
1. `spark contacts "name or domain"` - find their email address

**Perform an action on emails:**
1. `spark emails --filter "from:sender"` - find the email
2. `spark action archive <ID>` - archive it (or pin, snooze, etc.)

**Share an email with your team:**
1. `spark emails --filter "subject:keyword"` - find the email
2. `spark action shareInTeam <ID> --user alice@co.com` - share with a teammate

**Delegate an email to a teammate:**
1. `spark emails --filter "subject:keyword"` - find the email
2. `spark action assign <ID> --assignee bob@co.com --date 2026-04-15 --comment "Please handle this"`

**Mark delegated emails as done:**
1. `spark emails --filter "subject:keyword"` - find the email(s)
2. `spark action delegationComplete <ID1> <ID2>` - mark multiple as complete

**Find unassigned shared inbox emails:**
1. `spark emails shared@co.com:Inbox --filter "assigned_to:unassigned"` - list unassigned items
2. `spark action assign <ID> --assignee bob@co.com` - assign to a teammate

**Review what's assigned to a teammate:**
1. `spark emails --filter "assigned_to:bob@co.com"` - see their assignments
2. `spark emails --filter "is:shared_inbox_open"` - all open shared inbox items
3. `spark emails --filter "is:shared_inbox_done"` - completed items

**Manage a contact:**
1. `spark contacts "name or domain"` - find the contact email
2. `spark contact-action blockContact spammer@example.com` - block them (or accept, change category, etc.)

## Keeping this skill up to date

The CLI and this skill share a single version (`metadata.version` in the front-matter above). New features in newer Spark Desktop releases ship with an updated embedded skill. Backward compatibility is guaranteed within a major version, so the commands and flags documented here keep working - but newly added features won't appear in this file until it is reinstalled.

Check for an update when - and only when - you hit one of these signals:

- The user asks about a Spark feature, command, or flag that isn't documented here.
- A `spark` command fails with an "unknown command" or "unknown option" error you didn't expect.
- The user explicitly says they upgraded Spark or that the skill is out of date.

In those cases:

```bash
spark --version
```

If the printed version is greater than `metadata.version` above, reinstall and re-read this file before answering:

```bash
spark skill --install <parent-of-use-spark>
```

`<parent-of-use-spark>` is the directory containing the `use-spark/` folder this `SKILL.md` lives in.

Do not check on every session or before every command - this skill is the source of truth unless one of the signals above tells you otherwise.

## Tips

- Always quote multi-word arguments: `spark search "project update"`
- Combine filter operators in a single `--filter` string: `--filter "from:alice@co.com is:unread newer_than:7d"`
- Use `folders` to discover exact folder identifiers before passing them to `emails` or `search --in`
- Use `accounts` to discover calendar names before passing them to `events --in`
- The `search` command is best for topic-based queries; `emails` is best for browsing/filtering by metadata
- `thread` returns the full conversation - use it when you need the complete email text, not just metadata
