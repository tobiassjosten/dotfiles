OVERVIEW					*minpac-overview*

Minpac is a minimal package manager for Vim 8 (and Neovim).  This uses the
|packages| feature and the jobs feature (|job-channel-overview|) which have
been newly added on Vim 8.


==============================================================================
CONCEPT						*minpac-concept*

* Utilize Vim 8's packages feature.
* Parallel install/update using Vim 8's jobs feature.
* Simple.
* Fast.


==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS					*minpac-requirements*

* Vim 8.0.0050+ (or Neovim 0.2+)
* Git 1.9+
* OS: Windows, Linux or macOS


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					*minpac-installation*

Minpac should be installed under "pack/minpac/opt/" in the first directory in
the 'packpath' option.
Plugins installed under "pack/*/start/" are automatically added to the
'runtimepath' after .vimrc is sourced. However, minpac needs to be loaded
before that. Therefore, minpac should be installed under "opt" directory, and
should be loaded using `packadd minpac`.

Windows ~
 >
	cd /d %USERPROFILE%
	git clone https://github.com/k-takata/minpac.git ^
            vimfiles\pack\minpac\opt\minpac
<

Linux, macOS ~

Vim:
 >
	git clone https://github.com/k-takata/minpac.git \
            ~/.vim/pack/minpac/opt/minpac
<
Neovim (use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in place of `~/.config` if set on your system):
 >
	git clone https://github.com/k-takata/minpac.git \
            ~/.config/nvim/pack/minpac/opt/minpac
<

Sample .vimrc ~

Basic sample
 >
	packadd minpac

	call minpac#init()

	" minpac must have {'type': 'opt'} so that it can be loaded with
	" `packadd`.
	call minpac#add('k-takata/minpac', {'type': 'opt'})

	" Add other plugins here.
	call minpac#add('vim-jp/syntax-vim-ex')
	...

	" Load the plugins right now. (optional)
	"packloadall
<
Customizing 'packpath'

  If you want to use ".vim" directory instead of "vimfiles" even on Windows,
  you should add "~/.vim" on top of 'packpath': >

	set packpath^=~/.vim
	packadd minpac

	call minpac#init()
	...
<
Advanced sample

  You can write a .vimrc which can be also used even if minpac is not
  installed.
>
	" Try to load minpac.
	silent! packadd minpac

	if !exists('*minpac#init')
	  " minpac is not available.

	  " Settings for plugin-less environment.
	  ...
	else
	  " minpac is available.
	  call minpac#init()
	  call minpac#add('k-takata/minpac', {'type': 'opt'})

	  " Additional plugins here.
	  ...

	  " Plugin settings here.
	  ...
	endif

	" Common settings here.
	...
<
Load minpac on demand

  Very interestingly, minpac doesn't need to be loaded every time.  Unlike
  other plugin managers, it is needed only when updating, installing or
  cleaning the plugins.  This is because minpac itself doesn't handle the
  runtime path.
  You can define a user command to load minpac, reload .vimrc to register the
  information of plugins, then call |minpac#update()| or |minpac#clean()|. >

	" For a paranoia.
	" Normally `:set nocp` is not needed, because it is done automatically
	" when .vimrc is found.
	if &compatible
	  " `:set nocp` has many side effects. Therefore this should be done
	  " only when 'compatible' is set.
	  set nocompatible
	endif

	if exists('*minpac#init')
	  " minpac is loaded.
	  call minpac#init()
	  call minpac#add('k-takata/minpac', {'type': 'opt'})

	  " Additional plugins here.
	  call minpac#add('vim-jp/syntax-vim-ex')
	  ...
	endif

	" Plugin settings here.
	...

	" Define user commands for updating/cleaning the plugins.
	" Each of them loads minpac, reloads .vimrc to register the
	" information of plugins, then performs the task.
	command! PackUpdate packadd minpac | source $MYVIMRC | call minpac#update()
	command! PackClean  packadd minpac | source $MYVIMRC | call minpac#clean()
<
  Note that your .vimrc must be reloadable to use this.  E.g.:

  * `:set nocompatible` should not be executed twice to avoid side effects.
  * `:function!` should be used to define a user function.
  * `:command!` should be used to define a user command.
  * `:augroup!` should be used properly to avoid the same autogroups are
    defined twice.

USAGE						*minpac-usage*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*minpac-commands*

Minpac doesn't provide any commands.  Use the `:call` command to call minpac
functions.  E.g.: >
	" To install or update plugins:
	call minpac#update()

	" To uninstall unused plugins:
	call minpac#clean()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*minpac-functions*

minpac#init([{config}])				*minpac#init()*
	Initialize minpac.

	`{config}` is a Dictionary of options for configuring minpac.

		Option		Description ~
		dir		Package directory.  Default: the first
				directory of the 'packpath' option.
		package_name	Package name.  Default: "minpac"
		git		Git command.  Default: "git"
		depth		Default clone depth.  Default: 1
		jobs		Maximum job numbers.  If <= 0, unlimited.
				Default: 8
		verbose		Verbosity level (0 to 3).  Default: 1

	All plugins will be installed under the following directories:

	    "start" plugins: <dir>/pack/<package_name>/start/<plugin_name>
	    "opt" plugins:   <dir>/pack/<package_name>/opt/<plugin_name>


	"start" plugins will be automatically loaded after processing your
	|.vimrc|, or you can load them explicitly using `:packloadall` command.
	"opt" plugins can be loaded with `:packadd` command.
	See |packages| for detail.


minpac#add({url}[, {config}])			*minpac#add()*
	Register a plugin.

	{url} is a URL of a plugin.  It can be a short form
	("<github-account>/<repository>") or a valid git URL.
	Note: Unlike Vundle, a short form without <github-account>/ is not
	supported. (Because vim-scripts.org is not maintained now.)

	{config} is a Dictionary of options for configuring the plugin.

		 Option		Description  ~
		 name		Unique name of the plugin. *minpac-plugin_name*
				Also used as a local directory name.
				Default: derived from the repository name.
		 type		Type of the plugin.  "start" or "opt".
				Default: "start"
		 frozen		If 1, the plugin will not be updated
				automatically.  Default: 0
		 depth		If >= 1, it is used as a depth to be cloned.
				Default: 1 or specified value by
				|minpac#init()|.
		 branch		Used as a branch name to be cloned.
				Default: empty
		 do		Post-update hook.
				See |minpac-post-update-hooks|.
				Default: empty


minpac#update([{name}[, {config}]])			*minpac#update()*
	Install or update all plugins or the specified plugin.

	{name} is a unique name of a plugin (|minpac-plugin_name|).

	If {name} is omitted or an empty String, all plugins will be installed
	or updated.  Frozen plugins will be installed, but it will not be
	updated.

	If {name} is specified, only specified plugin will be installed or
	updated.  Frozen plugin will be also updated.  {name} can also be a
	list of plugin names.

	{config} is a Dictionary of options for configuring the function.

		 Option		Description  ~
		 do		Finish-update hook.
				See |minpac-finish-update-hooks|.
				Default: empty

	You can check the results with `:message` command.

	Note: This resets the 'more' option temporarily to avoid jobs being
	interrupted.


minpac#clean([{name}])				*minpac#clean()*
	Remove all plugins which are not registered, or remove the specified
	plugin.

	{name} is a name of a plugin.  It can be a unique plugin name
	(|minpac-plugin_name|) or a plugin name with wildcards ("*" and "?"
	are supported).

	If {name} is omitted, all plugins under the minpac directory will be
	checked.  If unregistered plugins are found, they are listed and a
	prompt is shown.  If you type "y", they will be removed.

	If {name} is specified, matched plugins are listed (even they are
	registered with |minpac#add()|) and a prompt is shown.  If you type
	"y", they will be removed.  {name} can also be a list of plugin names.


minpac#getpluginfo({name})			*minpac#getpluginfo()*
	Get information of specified plugin.

	{name} is a unique name of a plugin (|minpac-plugin_name|).
	A dictionary with following items will be returned:

		Item		Description ~
		url		URL of the plugin repository.
		dir		Local directory of the plugin.
		frozen		If 1, the plugin is frozen.
		type		Type of the plugin.
		branch		Branch name to be cloned.
		depth		Depth to be cloned.

						*minpac#getpackages()*
minpac#getpackages([{packname}[, {packtype}[, {plugname}[, {nameonly}]]]])
	Get a list of plugins under the package directories.

	{packname} specifies a package name. Wildcards can be used. If omitted
	or an empty string is specified, "*" is used.

	{packtype} is a type of the package. "*", "start", "opt" or "NONE" can
	be used.
	If "*" is specified, both start and opt packages are listed.
	If omitted or an empty string is specified, "*" is used.
	If "NONE" is specified, package directories are listed instead of
	plugin directories.

	{plugname} specifies a plugin name. Wildcards can be used. If omitted
	or an empty string is specified, "*" is used.

	If {nameonly} is 1, plugin (or package) names are listed instead of
	the direcotries. Default is 0.

	E.g.: >

	" List the all plugin directories under the package directories.
	" Includes plugins under "dist" package.
	echo minpac#getpackages()

	" List directories of "start" plugins under "minpac" package.
	echo minpac#getpackages("minpac", "start")

	" List plugin names under "minpac" package.
	echo minpac#getpackages("minpac", "", "", 1)

	" List package names.
	echo minpac#getpackages("", "NAME", "", 1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOOKS						*minpac-hooks*

Currently, minpac supports two types of hook: Post-update hooks and Finish-
update hooks.


POST-UPDATE HOOKS				*minpac-post-update-hooks*

If a plugin requires extra works (e.g. building a native module), you can use
the post-update hooks.

You can specify the hook with the `'do'` item in the option of the
|minpac#add()| function. It can be a String or a Funcref.
If a String is specified, it is executed as an Ex command.
If a Funcref is specified, it is called with two arguments; {hooktype} and
{name}.

		Argument	Description ~
		{hooktype}	Type of the hook.  'post-update' for post-
				update hooks.
		{name}		Name of the plugin.  |minpac-plugin_name|

The current directory is set to the directory of the plugin, when the hook is
invoked.

E.g.: >

	" Execute an Ex command as a hook.
	call minpac#add('Shougo/vimproc.vim', {'do': 'silent! !make'})

	" Execute a lambda function as a hook.
	" Parameters for a lambda can be omitted, if you don't need them.
	call minpac#add('Shougo/vimproc.vim', {'do': {-> system('make')}})

	" Of course, you can also use a normal user function as a hook.
	function! s:hook(hooktype, name)
	  echom a:hooktype
	  " You can use `minpac#getpluginfo()` to get the information about
	  " the plugin.
	  echom 'Directory:' minpac#getpluginfo(a:name).dir
	  call system('make')
	endfunction
	call minpac#add('Shougo/vimproc.vim', {'do': function('s:hook')})
<

The above examples execute the "make" command synchronously. If you want to
execute an external command asynchronously, you should use the |job_start()|
function on Vim 8 or the |jobstart()| function on Neovim.
You may also want to use the `minpac#job#start()` function, but this is mainly
for internal use and the specification is subject to change without notice.


FINISH-UPDATE HOOKS				*minpac-finish-update-hooks*

If you want to execute extra works after all plugins are updated, you can use
the finish-update hooks.

You can specify the hook with the `'do'` item in the option of the
|minpac#update()| function. It can be a String or a Funcref.
If a String is specified, it is executed as an Ex command.
If a Funcref is specified, it is called with three arguments; {hooktype},
{updated} and {installed}.

		Argument	Description ~
		{hooktype}	Type of the hook.  'finish-update' for finish-
				update hooks.
		{updated}	Number of the updated plugin.
		{installed}	Number of the newly installed plugin.

E.g.: >

	" Quit Vim immediately after all updates are finished.
	call minpac#update('', {'do': 'quit'})
<
